# ECMWF_Toolbox

In this repository I will upload the toolbox for ArcGIS 10.3.x to handle NetCDF files from ECMWF.
The first version of this toolbox includes only a script to create time averages of the rasters included in the NetCDF files.
In the next version I would like to include tools to extract specific dates, or average specific years.
If you have requests regarding possible tools you would like to see included here, in relation to ECMWF datasets, please send me an e-mail to: info[at]fabioveronesi.net

NOTE:
The scripts included here are created using the R-Bridge technology developed by ESRI. For more info on R-Bridge including installation tips go to: https://r-arcgis.github.io/
